GW-BASIC historical files
=========================

This is a collection of my old GW-BASIC scripts from around 1991-1996. My dad
had bought our first PC, a 386DX-40 which came with MS-DOS ... and GW-BASIC.

The oldest file I could dig out was dated 1992. I was 11 years at that time.



How to use
----------

[Microsoft just open-sourced GW-BASIC](https://github.com/microsoft/GW-BASIC).
However, if you're not into compiling that, the [gwbasic.exe can be downloaded on archive.org](https://archive.org/details/gwbasic.exe).
This should run fine in DOSBox.

Also, there's [PC-BASIC](https://github.com/robhagemans/pcbasic) which runs
wherever Python can run.
